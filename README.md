## Overview
This is a bot that can generate schedule graphics for start.gg events. Add this bot to your server and use the command "/get-schedule" to generate a graphic for all users in your server that have linked their Discord account to their start.gg account. When requesting a tournament graphic, the tournament identifier is the segment just after \"tournament\" in the url. For example, the tournament identifier for: https://www.start.gg/tournament/frosty-faustings-xvii-2025/events would be frosty-faustings-xvii-2025.
